chipKIT RTOS
============

This is both an attempt to build a new PIC32 Arduino-compatible core with FreeRTOS support, and an attempt to build, from the ground up,
an entire new PIC32 SDK based around FreeRTOS.

At the moment only the MZ chips are supported, but the plan is to expand it to all other PIC32 MZ chips in time.
